==================

A collection of slightly broken code, designed to be used in workshops and talks by speakers, and by curious learners

The notion is that many of us will put in code examples illustrating problems we've encountered or seen others encounter - or mashups between systems that don't quite work correctly, or some other kind of minor problem.

These exercises can be in any language, although they will be separated by problem type - ideally, a workshop could be done where users are encouraged to solve the problem in their language.  The format for the workshop could be a 5 minute session to solve one of the problems and then discussion about it, or it could be used to fill time while other workshop attendees catch up to them on a longer task.

There's a Google group for discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/island-of-broken-toys
